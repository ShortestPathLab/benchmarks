Here you can find a series of community-generated 3D pathfinding benchmarks that have appeared in the literature over the years. At present, these benchmarks only consist of voxel maps, the 3D equivalent to 2D grid maps. In the future, we aim to add other benchmark types such as continuous-environemnt descriptions.

With this website, we aim to provide an overarching gateway for easy navigation between these various domains and to facilitate convenient attribution for each benchmark data set. We further aim to enable clear comparisons between various works in the literature on these benchmarks through clear version control and documentation.
