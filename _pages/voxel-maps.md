Here you can find a series of currently available voxel-world benchmarks for 3D pathfinding. A *voxel* is a unit size volume element, essentially the 3D equivalent to a unit cell in a 2D grid. One of these data sets, the **Warframe** benchmarks, is developed by MovingAI and was the first to appear in the literature. The other three voxel benchmarks were constructed as part of our own work in order to help bridge-the-gap between the varied motivations of practitioners (drone navigation, pipe routing, video games) and the domains of available problems (aerial video game traversal).

In particular, we have developed the **Sandstone**, **Descent**, and **Industrial Plant** data sets, using advanced methods of problem generation to select only a small, but comprehensive set of problems from across the entire distribution fo difficulty. We present each of these problem instances along with useful metrics in an informed order of increasing difficulty, allowing users to quickly identify performance indicators and to reach more nuanced conclusions.

While we focus here only on *voxel* gridmaps due to their nice properties and high solution quality (i.e. small detours from the true path distance), there are of course many other ways to represent and search in 3D space. These open several other doors and come with their own interesting problems. In the future, we would like to expand this section to include other such benchmarks such as using Sparse Voxel Octrees. For the meantime, however, the below sections detail the four currently available voxel-world benchmarks in the literature, which allow us to begin investigating the wide open area of 3D search.

## The Warframe Benchmarks

[Civil Procedure: An Open-Source Casebook (Fink 2023)](../casebook) ("Casebook"). The casebook is posted online as part of the course website: [emfink.net/CivilProcedure](http://www.emfink.net/CivilProcedure). PDF copies of each chapter are available for download on the [Table of Contents](https://www.emfink.net/CivilProcedure/casebook/contents/) page. 

Your final grade for the term will be based on interim quizzes (30%) and a final exam (70%):

- There will be three quizzes (open-book/open-notes), consisting of multiple-choice questions. You will take the quizzes online outside of class, any time during the dates indicated in the course schedule below. The quizzes are intended to help you assess your understanding of the material and identify topics for further review. The quiz portion of your final grade will be based on your two best quiz results. 
- The final exam (closed-book/closed-note) will consist of essay and short-answer questions. You will take the final exam at the Law School on the date indicated in the course schedule below.
