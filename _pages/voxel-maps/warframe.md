The benchmarks in this directory are due to Nathan Sturtevant and are mirrored from his repository at MovingAI.com(https://movingai.com/benchmarks/voxels.html). The ones available here are all Version 1 (ca. 2018).

Digital Extremes, a games company in London, Ontario, Canada has made voxel data freely available from their game Warframe to start a new repository of 3D voxel grids. (Pixels are picture elements; voxels are volume elements).
