Home of the Iron Harvest benchmarks. Using data from Iron Harvest, a recent real-time strategy game, we provide 35 distinct maps and 70,000 associated problem instances. Each map has three different representations: navigation mesh, obstacle map and grid. There are 2,000 co-feasible instances per map which allow comparisons across the different representations. We describe the benchmark, our instance generation approach and provide experimental results for some currently leading grid-based and mesh-based path planners.
