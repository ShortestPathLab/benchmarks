## The 9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge - Shortest Paths

Road maps are a common benchmark for testing performance on road networks---created for the 9th DIMACS Challenge. These files are too big to mirror here, but they are available for download from the [competition homepage]('https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/').

Road maps are composed of a graph containing *n* nodes and *m* arcs. Each graph can be directed or undirected, depending on the problem being studied. Graphs can also have parallel ars and self-loops. Each arc has an associated integer arc weight: these weights could represent various metrics such as physical distance or transit time.
