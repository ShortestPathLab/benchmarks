G'Day! We are ***the Shortest Path Lab***, a group of researchers actively engaged and interested in all forms of Pathfinding (both 2D and 3D) and Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problems. We hail all the way from *Monash University* in Melbourne, Australia. If you want to know more about us, head over to our <a href="https://pathfinding.ai" target="_blank">**homepage**</a>.

This website, however, aims to provide a convenient landing page for a wide-variety of pathfinding benchmarks from various works across the literature. With this, we hope to facilitate efficient and more *confident* comparions between works in our community.

Here, you will find mirrors of the many **widespread publicly available benchmarks** in the literature, and we further host benchmarks developed by our lab. Each data set has clear attribution and follow-through links for those wishing to use these benchmarks in their own work. We provide mirrors of these benchmarks for the purpose of maintaining **transparent version control;** this helps to avoid misleading conclusions when comparing two works on the same benchmarks at different times---perhaps reporting results on completely different problems!

If we have missed any benchmarks, feel free to <a href="mailto:shortest-path-lab@monash.edu" target="_blank">**reach out!**</a>
