Here you can find a series of community-generated 2D pathfinding benchmarks that have appeared in the literature over the years. These benchmarks take a variety of forms: from grid maps to mesh maps, to polygon maps.

With this website, we aim to provide an overarching gateway for easy navigation between these various domains and to facilitate convenient attribution for each benchmark data set. We further aim to enable clear comparisons between various works in the literature on these benchmarks through clear version control and documentation.
